## Installation

## Start

Connect the styles first. You can do this using a js file, however, we recommend that you connect using ``@import`` and defining layers so that there are no conflicts with specificity.

```css
  @import url('@/shared/styles/normalize.css') layer(reset);
  @import url('@adara-cs/ui-kit-web/dist/index.css') layer(library);

  @layer reset, library, components, overrides;
```

Start using

```typescript
  import { Button } from '@adara-cs/ui-kit-web';

  ...

  <Button>Hello, world!</Button>
```


## Running Tests
