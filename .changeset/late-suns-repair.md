Added Storybook descriptions to all composite components (e.g. `Pagination`, `Avatar`, `Modal`, `Drawer`, `Table`, `PinField`, etc.), improving documentation clarity and discoverability.

Each part (such as `PaginationItem`, `AvatarFallback`, `ModalTrigger`, `TableRow`, etc.) now includes a concise functional description to help developers understand its role and usage at a glance.
