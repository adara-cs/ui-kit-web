Refactored Icon component to accept icon objects directly from `@adara-cs/icons` instead of using the `name` prop. Also added support for passing custom icons.  

Improved size customization across components â€” icon sizes are now based on the parent element in components like PasswordField, NumberField, IconButton, and Checkbox.
