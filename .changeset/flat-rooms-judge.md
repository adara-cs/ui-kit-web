ðŸ†• Slot Component

â€¢ Introduced a universal <Slot /> component  
â€¢ Enables the `asChild` pattern (zero-wrapper components)  
â€¢ Forwards ref, event handlers, className, style, and data-/aria-attributes  
â€¢ Chains both parent and child event handlers without dropping any behavior

ðŸŽ¯ `asChild` Support in Core Components

The following components now support the `asChild` prop:

â€¢ Button  
â€¢ ButtonBase  
â€¢ IconButton  
â€¢ CollapsibleTrigger

This allows them to render their behavior into a custom child element instead of their own default DOM element.

Example:

```tsx
<Button asChild>
  <a href="/about">Read more</a>
</Button>
```

ðŸ§± Slot-Based Architecture for Overlays

The following interactive components have been refactored into explicit Trigger/Content pairs:

â€¢ SheetTrigger / SheetContent
â€¢ DrawerTrigger / DrawerContent
â€¢ TooltipTrigger / TooltipContent
â€¢ ModalTrigger / ModalContent
â€¢ PopoverTrigger / PopoverContent

Trigger components now support asChild as well, allowing full control over the trigger element:

```tsx
<PopoverTrigger asChild>
  <button>Open Popover</button>
</PopoverTrigger>
```

ðŸ“¦ Benefits

â€¢ No unnecessary wrappers â€” cleaner, flatter DOM
â€¢ Full ref support, ideal for imperative focus and DOM access
â€¢ Fully type-safe, including event handler inference
â€¢ Semantic-friendly â€” works perfectly with <a>, <button>, <form>, <input>, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

â€¢ When using asChild, the children must be a single valid React element
â€¢ An error will be thrown at runtime if an invalid child is passed

ðŸš€ This release establishes a foundation for fully slot-based, composable components across the entire design system.
